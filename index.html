The construction industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution, due to the 
impacts of the vast amounts of hazardous waste produced.This articles explores the negative impacts 
of inefficient recycling procedures in construction and the strategies used to tackle them, specifically
in developing countries.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
The development of society has been led by people’s ability to use newly discovered materials to
their advantage. As new materials are found, the move towards the construction industry being
more sustainable become attainable. However, the recycling procedures of these aren’t as efficient
as they need to be. This issue is highlighted as it is reported that, 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal
solid waste is generated worldwide. (Singh, P. et al. 2023) 400 tonnes of this is hazardous
construction waste, (Blundell, S. 2019) this consists of any un-recyclable materials produced on
construction sites that have substances which can cause harm to ecosystems or people. (Brunn, M. 
2022) Hazardous waste such as lead based paints, asbestos and solvents are mostly generated by
the demolition of high-rise buildings and establishments.(Reference) Due to the rate at which this is
being done, it is crucial that efficient recycling methods be put in place, and to reduce the
construction industry’s ecological footprint. Recycling in developing countries is more difficult to
carry out due to the lack of education and resources. However, it is also important to acknowledge 
that these countries may struggle to adopt these procedures due to social, economic and geographical factors.

Waste generation is often correlated with income and urbanisation, it is therefore normal to assume that 
high-income countries generate more waste than low-income countries. This assumption is true as high-income 
countries account for 16% of the world’s population and 34% of its waste while lower income countries account 
for 9% of population and 5% of waste. (George, M. 2021)

Hazardous waste poses serious threat to human health and the environment when not recycled properly, 
making it even more imperative to practice sustainable procedures. Developed countries have made significant 
strides to mitigate the impacts of hazardous waste in construction, including comprehensive waste management plans 
and advanced technology.

Developed countries usually have robust regulatory processes in place, these include detailed waste management 
plans that outline strategies for minimising, segregating, and disposing of hazardous waste responsibly. Regulations 
within the construction industry ensure adherence to these rules, promoting transparency and accountability. Due to 
the knowledge and access to sustainable resources, developed countries often invest in modern equipment and processes. 
These include advanced sorting technologies and waste-to-energy systems. 

In contrast, developing countries face unique challenges with addressing the recycling of hazardous waste in this industry. 
Limited financial resources and lack of awareness can hinder the implementation of efficient waste management procedures. 

Liberia is a developing country that struggles to combat the issue of dumping waste and the pollution caused by it. Their 
most common method of waste disposal is door-to-door collection, which ultimately results in 55% of the generated waste not 
being collected, (Singh, P. et al. 2023) as not all households and businesses chose or can take part in this. This means that 
45% of generated waste in Liberia ends up being disposed of incorrectly, polluting the environment further. It was found that 
250kt of e-waste was illegally imported into the country (Singh, P. et al. 2023), which was a result of the lack of regulatory 
frameworks for the control of these correct recycling procedures. E-waste can be particularly damaging for countries already 
struggling to tackle the recycling of hazardous waste as it consists of discarded electronic devices.  (Kimelman, T. 2021).

In comparison, Singapore is a densely populated country that is ultimately more susceptible to infectious disease outbreaks due to 
their climate. They therefore have processes put in place to regulate waste generation and disposal to avoid such incidents. (Singh, P. et al. 2023). 
The municipal solid waste generated in Singapore, rose from 4.70 million tonnes to 5.9 million tonnes between 1996 and 2008 (Zhang et al., 2010). 
However, to make indirect waste collection easier, the country uses a centralised refuse-chute. Due to their awareness around the environment, Singapore 
also use other ways to minimise waste generation. This includes recycling of plants to convert horticultural waste into beneficial soil ingredients.
(Singh, P. et al. 2023)
