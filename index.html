The construction industry, a driving force behind economic development, is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution, due to the impacts of 
the vast amounts of hazardous waste produced. This articles explores the negative impacts of inefficient recycling procedures in construction and the strategies 
used to tackle them, specifically in developing countries.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
The development of society has been led by people’s ability to use newly discovered materials to their advantage. As new materials are 
found, the move towards the construction industry being more sustainable becomes attainable. However, the recycling procedures of these 
aren’t as efficient as they need to be. This issue is highlighted as it is reported that, 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste 
is generated worldwide.<a href="#References">(Singh, P. et al. 2023)</a> 400 tonnes of this is hazardous construction waste,<a href="#References">(Blundell, S. 2019)</a> 
this consists of any un-recyclable materials produced on construction sites that have substances which can cause harm to ecosystems or people. 
<a href="#References">(Brunn, M. 2022)</a> Hazardous waste such as lead based paints, asbestos and solvents are mostly generated by the demolition 
of high-rise buildings and establishments.<a href="#References#">(Varshney et al., 2021)</a>Due to the rate at which this is being done, it is crucial that efficient 
recycling methods be put in place, and to reduce the construction industry’s ecological footprint. Recycling in developing countries is 
more difficult to carry out due to the lack of education and resources. However, it is also important to acknowledge that these countries 
may struggle to adopt these procedures due to social, economic and geographical factors.

Waste generation is often correlated with income and urbanisation, it is therefore normal to assume that high-income countries generate more waste 
than low-income countries. This assumption is true as high-income countries account for 16% of the world’s population and 34% of its waste while 
lower income countries account for 9% of population and 5% of waste, as seen in figure 1. <a href="#References">(George, M. 2021)</a>

Hazardous waste poses serious threat to human health and the environment when not recycled properly, making it even more imperative to practice 
sustainable procedures. Developed countries have made significant strides to mitigate the impacts of hazardous waste in construction, including 
comprehensive waste management plans and advanced technology.

Developed countries usually have robust regulatory processes in place, these include detailed waste management plans that outline strategies 
for minimising, segregating, and disposing of hazardous waste responsibly. Regulations within the construction industry ensure adherence 
to these rules, promoting transparency and accountability. Due to the knowledge and access to sustainable resources, developed countries 
often invest in modern equipment and processes. These include advanced sorting technologies and waste-to-energy systems. 

In contrast, developing countries face unique challenges with addressing the recycling of hazardous waste in this industry. Limited financial 
resources and lack of awareness can hinder the implementation of efficient waste management procedures. 

Liberia is a developing country that struggles to combat the issue of dumping waste and the pollution caused by it. Their most common method 
of waste disposal is door-to-door collection, which ultimately results in 55% of the generated waste not being collected, <a href="#References">
(Singh, P. et al. 2023) </a> as not all households and businesses chose or can take part in this. This means that 45% of generated waste in 
Liberia ends up being disposed of incorrectly, polluting the environment further. It was found that 250kt of e-waste was illegally imported into 
the country <a href="#References">(Singh, P. et al. 2023)</a>, which was a result of the lack of regulatory frameworks for the control of these 
correct recycling procedures. E-waste can be particularly damaging for countries already struggling to tackle the recycling of hazardous waste 
as it consists of discarded electronic devices. <a href="#References">(Kimelman, T. 2021).</a>

In comparison, Singapore is a densely populated country that is ultimately more susceptible to infectious disease outbreaks due to their climate. 
They therefore have processes put in place to regulate waste generation and disposal to avoid such incidents. <a href="#References">(Singh, P. et al. 2023). </a>
The municipal solid waste generated in Singapore, rose from 4.70 million tonnes to 5.9 million tonnes between 1996 and 2008 <a href="#References">(Zhang et al., 2010).</a>
However, to make indirect waste collection easier, the country uses a centralised refuse-chute. Due to their awareness around the environment, 
Singapore also use other ways to minimise waste generation. This includes recycling of plants to convert horticultural waste into beneficial 
soil ingredients. <a href="#References">(Singh, P. et al. 2023)</a>

The main concern of incorrect hazardous waste management is the effect it has on the environment and people. When done correctly, it will 
be beneficial in lowering costs, optimising the use of resources and reducing our carbon footprint. <a href="#References">(Kanagamani, K., Geethamani, P. and Narmatha, M. 2020)</a>
While the challenges may seem daunting, there are opportunities for both developing and developed countries to adopt more sustainable practices. 

Developing countries can prioritise building programs to educate construction professionals, workers and regulatory authorities about the environmental 
impact of hazardous waste. Training initiatives can promote awareness and instil the best practices for waste reduction and proper disposal. Governments 
in developing countries can incentivise sustainable construction practices by offering financial incentives to companies that adopt environmentally friendly approaches. 

High-income countries can do this and much more considering they have many more sustainable resources and the financial stability to do so. Despite having strong 
regulatory frameworks, they can incorporate stricter guidelines for hazardous waste management.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
  <pre>
The construction industry’s impact on hazardous waste is a global concern, and addressing this issue requires involvement from both developing and developed 
countries. Although developing countries have more of a role in inefficient waste recycling, high-income countries have the resources and opportunities to reduce 
the negative environmental impacts of hazardous waste. By focusing on education, international collaboration, incentivising sustainable procedures and strengthening
regulatory framework, the construction industry can contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future.
