The construction industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental pollution, due to the 
impacts of the vast amounts of hazardous waste produced.This articles explores the negative impacts 
of inefficient recycling procedures in construction and the strategies used to tackle them, specifically
in developing countries.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
    <pre>
The development of society has been led by people’s ability to use newly discovered materials to
their advantage. As new materials are found, the move towards the construction industry being
more sustainable become attainable. However, the recycling procedures of these aren’t as efficient
as they need to be. This issue is highlighted as it is reported that, 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal
solid waste is generated worldwide. (Singh, P. et al. 2023) 400 tonnes of this is hazardous
construction waste, (Blundell, S. 2019) this consists of any un-recyclable materials produced on
construction sites that have substances which can cause harm to ecosystems or people. (Brunn, M. 
2022) Hazardous waste such as lead based paints, asbestos and solvents are mostly generated by
the demolition of high-rise buildings and establishments.(Reference) Due to the rate at which this is
being done, it is crucial that efficient recycling methods be put in place, and to reduce the
construction industry’s ecological footprint. Recycling in developing countries is more difficult to
carry out due to the lack of education and resources. However, it is also important to acknowledge 
that these countries may struggle to adopt these procedures due to social, economic and geographical factors.

Waste generation is often correlated with income and urbanisation, it is therefore normal to assume that 
high-income countries generate more waste than low-income countries. This assumption is true as high-income 
countries account for 16% of the world’s population and 34% of its waste while lower income countries account 
for 9% of population and 5% of waste. (George, M. 2021)
